Introduction
============

This document describes providing guidelines on how to install and configure the Brahmaputra WP1 release of OPNFV when using Fuel as a deployment tool including required software and hardware configurations.

Although the available installation options gives a high degree of freedom in how the system is set-up including architecture, services and features, etc. said permutations may not provide an OPNFV compliant reference architecture. This instruction provides a step-by-step guide that results in an OPNFV Brahmaputra WP1 compliant deployment.

The audience of this document is assumed to have good knowledge in networking and Unix/Linux administration.

Preface
=======

Before starting the installation of the Brahmaputra WP1 release of OPNFV when using Fuel as a deployment tool, some planning must be done.

Retrieving the ISO image
------------------------

First of all, the Fuel deployment ISO image needs to be retrieved, the .iso image of the Brahmaputra WP1 release of OPNFV when using Fuel as a deployment tool can be found at http://artifacts.opnfv.org/fuel/opnfv-2015-11-19_03-04-21.iso   NOTE: TO BE UPDATED WITH FINAL B-REL ARTIFACT


Building the ISO image
----------------------


Alternatively, you may build the .iso from source by cloning the opnfv/genesis git repository.  To retrieve the repository for the Arno release use the following command:

- git clone https://<linux foundation uid>@gerrit.opnf.org/gerrit/fuel

Check-out the Brahmaputra WP1 release tag to set the branch to the baseline required to replicate the Brahmaputra WP1 release:

- TODO: NEEDS UPDATE TO REFLECT WP1 TAG / NEW REPO - cd genesis; git checkout stable/arno2015.2.0

Go to the fuel directory and build the .iso:

- cd fuel/build; make all

For more information on how to build, please see "OPNFV Build instructions for - Brahmaputra WP1 release of OPNFV when using Fuel as a deployment tool which you retrieved with the repository at </fuel/fuel/docs/src/build-instructions.rst>

Next, familiarize yourself with the Fuel 7.0 version by reading the following documents:

- Fuel planning guide <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/planning-guide.html>

- Fuel user guide <http://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html>

- Fuel operations guide <http://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/operations.html>

- Fuel Plugin Developers Guide <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins>

A number of deployment specific parameters must be collected, those are:

1.     Provider sub-net and gateway information

2.     Provider VLAN information

3.     Provider DNS addresses

4.     Provider NTP addresses

5.     Network Topology you plan to Deploy (VLAN, GRE(VXLAN), FLAT)

6.     Linux Distro you intend to deploy.

7.     How many nodes and what roles you want to deploy (Controllers, Storage, Computes)

8.     Monitoring Options you want to deploy (Ceilometer, MongoDB).

9.     Other options not covered in the document are available in the links above


This information will be needed for the configuration procedures provided in this document.

Help with Hardware Requirements
===============================


Calculate hardware requirements:

Refer to the OpenStack Hardware Compability List  <https://www.mirantis.com/products/openstack-drivers-and-plugins/hardware-compatibility-list/> for more information on various hardware types available for use. 

When choosing the hardware on which you will deploy your OpenStack environment, you should think about:

        - CPU -- Consider the number of virtual machines that you plan to deploy in your cloud environment and the CPU per virtual machine.
        - Memory -- Depends on the amount of RAM assigned per virtual machine and the controller node.
        - Storage -- Depends on the local drive space per virtual machine, remote volumes that can be attached to a virtual machine, and object storage.
        - Networking -- Depends on the Choose Network Topology, the network bandwidth per virtual machine, and network storage.


Top of the rack (TOR) Configuration requirements
================================================

The switching infrastructure provides connectivity for the OPNFV infrastructure operations, tenant networks (East/West) and provider connectivity (North/South bound connectivity); it also provides needed connectivity for the storage Area Network (SAN). To avoid traffic congestion, it is strongly suggested that three physically separated networks are used, that is: 1 physical network for administration and control, one physical network for tenant private and public networks, and one physical network for SAN. The switching connectivity can (but does not need to) be fully redundant, in such case it and comprises a redundant 10GE switch pair for each of the three physically separated networks.

The physical TOR switches are **not** automatically configured from the OPNFV reference platform. All the networks involved in the OPNFV infrastructure as well as the provider networks and the private tenant VLANs needs to be manually configured.

Manual configuration of the Brahmaputra WP1 hardware platform should be carried out according to the Pharos specification TODO-<insert link to Pharos ARNO SR1 Specification>

OPNFV Software installation and deployment
==========================================

This section describes the installation of the OPNFV installation server (Fuel master) as well as the deployment of the full OPNFV reference platform stack across a server cluster.

Install Fuel master
-------------------
1. Mount the Brahmaputra WP1 ISO file as a boot device to the jump host server.

2. Reboot the jump host to establish the Fuel server.

   - The system now boots from the ISO image.

   - Select 'DVD Fuel Install (Static IP)'

   - Press [Enter].

3. Wait until screen Fuel setup is shown (Note: This can take up to 30 minutes).

4. In the 'Fuel User' Section - Confirm/change the default password 
    
   - Enter 'admin' in the Fuel password input

   - Enter 'admin' in the Confim password input

   - Select 'Check' and press [Enter]

5. In 'Network Setup' Section - Configure DHCP/Static IP information for your FUEL node - For example, ETH0 is 10.20.0.2/24 for FUEL booting and ETH1 is DHCP in your corporate/lab network.

   - Configure eth1 or other network interfaces here as well (if you have them present on your FUEL server).

6. In 'PXE Setup' Section - Change the following fields to appropriate values (example below):

   - DHCP Pool Start 10.20.0.3

   - DHCP Pool End 10.20.0.254

   - DHCP Pool Gateway  10.20.0.2 (ip of Fuel node)

7. In 'DNS & Hostname' - Change the following fields to appropriate values:

   - Hostname <OPNFV Region name>-fuel

   - Domain <Domain Name>

   - Search Domain <Search Domain Name>

   - External DNS

   - Hostname to test DNS <Hostname to test DNS>
 
   - Select 'Check' and press [Enter]


8. OPTION TO ENABLE PROXY SUPPORT - In 'Bootstrap Image', edit the following fields to define a proxy.

	NOTE: cannot be used in tandem with local repo support
	NOTE: not tested with ODL for support (plugin)

   - Navigate to 'HTTP proxy' and input your http proxy address 

   - Select 'Check' and press [Enter]

 
9. In 'Time Sync' Section - Change the following fields to appropriate values:

   - NTP Server 1 <Customer NTP server 1>

   - NTP Server 2 <Customer NTP server 2>

   - NTP Server 3 <Customer NTP server 3>

10. Start the installation.

   - Select Quit Setup and press Save and Quit.

   - Installation starts, wait until a screen with logon credentials is shown.


Boot the Node Servers
---------------------

After the Fuel Master node has rebooted from the above step and is at the login prompt, you should boot the Node Servers (Your Compute/Control/Storage blades (nested or real)) with a PXE Booting Scheme so that the FUEL 
Master can pick them up for control.

11. Enable PXE booting

    - For every controller and compute server: enable PXE Booting as the first boot device in the BIOS boot order menu and hard disk as the second boot device in the same menu.

12. Reboot all the control and compute blades.

13. Wait for the availability of nodes showing up in the Fuel GUI.

    - Connect to the FUEL UI via the URL provided in the Console (default: http://10.20.0.2:8000)
    
    - Wait until all nodes are displayed in top right corner of the Fuel GUI: <total number of server> TOTAL NODES and <total number of servers> UNALLOCATED NODES.



Install ODL Plugin on FUEL node
-------------------------------

NOTE: CURRENTLY DISABLED IN B-REL WP1

14. SSH to your FUEL node   (e.g. root@10.20.0.2  pwd: r00tme)

15. Verify the plugin exists at /opt/opnfv/opendaylight-0.6-0.6.1-1.noarch.rpm

16. Install the plugin with the command

    - "fuel plugins --install /opt/opnfv/opendaylight-0.6-0.6.1-1.noarch.rpm"

    - Expected output: "Plugin opendaylight-0.6-0.6.1-1.noarch.rpm was successfully installed."


Create an OPNFV Environment
