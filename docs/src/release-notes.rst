Important notes
===============

For the first OPNFV release (Arno), these notes introduce use of `OpenStack Fuel <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel>` for the deployment stage of the OPNFV continuous integration (CI) pipeline.  The goal of the Arno release and this Fuel-based deployment process is to establish a foundational platform accelerating further development of the OPNFV infrastructure.

Carefully follow the installation-instructions and pay special attention to the pre-deploy script that needs to be run before deployment is started.

Summary
=======

For Arno SR1, the typical use of Fuel as an OpenStack installer is supplemented with OPNFV unique components such as `OpenDaylight <http://www.opendaylight.org/software>`_ version Helium as well as OPNFV-unique configurations.

This Arno artefact provides Fuel as the deployment stage tool in the OPNFV CI pipeline including:

- Documentation built by Jenkins
  - this document (release notes)
  - installation instructions
  - build-instructions
- The Arno Fuel installer image (.iso) built by Jenkins
- Automated deployment of Arno with running on bare metal or a nested hypervisor environment (KVM)
- Automated validation of the Arno deployment
