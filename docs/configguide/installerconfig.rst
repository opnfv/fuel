Fuel configuration
==================
This section describes providing guidelines on how to install and
configure the Brahmaputra release of OPNFV when using Fuel as a
deployment tool including required software and hardware
configurations.

Although the available installation options gives a high degree of
freedom in how the system is set-up including architecture, services
and features, etc. said permutations may not provide an OPNFV
compliant reference architecture. This section provides a
step-by-step guide that results in an OPNFV Brahmaputra compliant
deployment.

The audience of this section is assumed to have good knowledge in
networking and Unix/Linux administration.

Pre-configuration activities
-----------------------------

Planning the deployment

Before starting the installation of the Brahmaputra WP1 release of
OPNFV when using Fuel as a deployment tool, some planning must be
done.

Next, familiarize yourself with the Fuel 7.0 version by reading the
following documents:

- Fuel planning guide
  <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/planning-guide.html>

- Fuel user guide
  <http://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html>

- Fuel operations guide
  <http://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/operations.html>


A number of deployment specific parameters must be collected, those are:

#.     Provider sub-net and gateway information

#.     Provider VLAN information

#.     Provider DNS addresses

#.     Provider NTP addresses

#.     Network Topology you plan to Deploy (VLAN, GRE(VXLAN), FLAT)

#.     Linux Distro you intend to deploy.

#.     How many nodes and what roles you want to deploy (Controllers,
Storage, Computes)

#.     Monitoring Options you want to deploy (Ceilometer, MongoDB).

#.     Other options not covered in the document are available in the
links above


Retrieving the ISO image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First of all, the Fuel deployment ISO image needs to be retrieved, the
.iso image of the Brahmaputra release of OPNFV when using Fuel as
a deployment tool can be found at:

NOTE: TO BE UPDATED WITH FINAL B-RELASE ARTIFACT

Alternatively, you may build the .iso from source by cloning the
opnfv/genesis git repository.  To retrieve the repository for the Arno
release use the following command:

- git clone https://<linux foundation uid>@gerrit.opnf.org/gerrit/fuel

Check-out the Brahmaputra release tag to set the branch to the
baseline required to replicate the Brahmaputra release:

- TODO: NEEDS UPDATE TO REFLECT WP1 TAG / NEW REPO - cd genesis; git
  checkout stable/arno2015.2.0

Go to the fuel directory and build the .iso:

- cd fuel/build; make all

For more information on how to build, please see "OPNFV Build
instructions for - Brahmaputra WP1 release of OPNFV when using Fuel as
a deployment tool which you retrieved with the repository at
</fuel/fuel/docs/src/build-instructions.rst>

Top of the rack (TOR) Configuration requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The switching infrastructure provides connectivity for the OPNFV
infrastructure operations, tenant networks (East/West) and provider
connectivity (North/South bound connectivity); it also provides needed
connectivity for the storage Area Network (SAN). To avoid traffic
congestion, it is strongly suggested that three physically separated
networks are used, that is: 1 physical network for administration and
control, one physical network for tenant private and public networks,
and one physical network for SAN. The switching connectivity can (but
does not need to) be fully redundant, in such case it and comprises a
redundant 10GE switch pair for each of the three physically separated
networks.

The physical TOR switches are **not** automatically configured from
the OPNFV reference platform. All the networks involved in the OPNFV
infrastructure as well as the provider networks and the private tenant
VLANs needs to be manually configured.

Manual configuration of the Brahmaputra hardware platform should
be carried out according to the Pharos specification TODO-<insert link
to Pharos ARNO SR1 Specification>

Jumphost configuration
-----------------------
The Jumphost server requires 2 (4 if redundancy is required) ethernet interfaces - one for external management of the OPNFV installation, and another for jump-host communication with the OPNFV cluster.

Install the Fuel jump-host
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Mount the Brahmaputra WP1 ISO file as a boot device to the jump host server.

#. Reboot the jump host to establish the Fuel server.

Fuel-Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fuel plugins enable you to install and configure additional capabilities for
your Fuel OPNFV based cloud, such as additional storage types, networking
functionality, or NFV features developed by OPNFV.

Fuel offers an open source framework for creating these plugins, so thereâ€™s a wide range of capabilities that you can enable Fuel to add to your OpenStack clouds.

The OPNFV Brahmaputra version of Fuel provides a set of pre-packaged plugins developed by OPNFV:

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
|  **Plugin name**   | **Short description**                                |
|                    |                                                      |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
|                    |                                                      |
|                    |                                                      |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
*Additional third-party plugins can be found here:*
*https://www.mirantis.com/products/openstack-drivers-and-plugins/fuel-plugins/*

The plugins come prepackaged, ready to install. To do so follow the instructions below:

#. SSH to your FUEL node (e.g. ssh root@10.20.0.2  pwd: r00tme)

#. Verify that the plugins you intend to install exists at /opt/opnfv/

#. Install the plugins of your choice with the command

    - "fuel plugins --install /opt/opnfv/<plugin-package-name>.rpm
