Automated post installation activities

These validates the installation in terms of configuration, services,
networking, storage, policies, etc.
The execution of the full range of health checks takes less than 30 minutes.

For instructions on how to run health-checks, please refer to the installation instructions: <TODO>

Platform components validation

feature specific validation/health-checks.
