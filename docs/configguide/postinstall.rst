Fuel post installation procedures
=================================

Automated post installation activities
--------------------------------------
Fuel provides a fairly broad coverage of built in automated health checks.
These validate the installation in terms of configuration, services,
networking, storage, policies, etc.
The execution of the full range of health checks takes less than 30 minutes.

For instructions on how to run health-checks, please read the Fuel installation
instructions.

Platform components validation
------------------------------
Consult the feature sections in this document for any post-install
feature specific validation/health-checks.
