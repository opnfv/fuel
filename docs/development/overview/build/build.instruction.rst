Abstract
========

This document describes how to build the Fuel deployment tool for the
Danube release of OPNFV build system, dependencies and required
system resources.

============
Introduction
============

This document describes the build system used to build the Fuel
deployment tool for the Danube release of OPNFV, required
dependencies and minimum requirements on the host to be used for the
build system.

The Fuel build system is designed around Docker containers such that
dependencies outside of the build system can be kept to a minimum. It
also shields the host from any potential dangerous operations
performed by the build system.

The audience of this document is assumed to have good knowledge in
network and Unix/Linux administration.

============
Requirements
============

Minimum Hardware Requirements
=============================

- ~30 GB available disc

- 4 GB RAM

Minimum Software Requirements
=============================

The build host should run Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04 operating system.

On the host, the following packages must be installed:

- An x86_64 host (Bare-metal or VM) with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed

  - **Note:** Builds on Wily (Ubuntu 15.x) are currently not supported
  - A kernel equal- or later than 3.19 (Vivid), simply available through

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid

- docker - see https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/ for
  installation notes for Ubuntu 14.04. Note: use the latest version from
  Docker (docker-engine) and not the one in Ubuntu 14.04.

- git (simply available through $ sudo apt-get install git)

- make (simply available through $ sudo apt-get install make)

- curl (simply available through $ sudo apt-get install curl)

============
Preparations
============

Setting up the Docker build container
=====================================

After having installed Docker, add yourself to the docker group:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo usermod -a -G docker [userid]

Also make sure to define relevant DNS servers part of the global
DNS chain in your </etc/default/docker> configuration file.
Uncomment, and modify the values appropriately.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    DOCKER_OPTS=" --dns=8.8.8.8 --dns=8.8.8.4"

Then restart docker:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo service docker restart

Setting up OPNFV Gerrit in order to being able to clone the code
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Start setting up OPNFV gerrit by creating a SSH key (unless you
  don't already have one), create one with ssh-keygen

- Add your generated public key in OPNFV Gerrit <https://gerrit.opnfv.org/>
  (this requires a Linux foundation account, create one if you do not
  already have one)

- Select "SSH Public Keys" to the left and then "Add Key" and paste
  your public key in.

Clone the OPNFV code Git repository with your SSH key
-----------------------------------------------------

Now it is time to clone the code repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone ssh://<Linux foundation user>@gerrit.opnfv.org:29418/fuel

Now you should have the OPNFV fuel repository with the Fuel
directories stored locally on your build host.

Check out the Danube release:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd fuel
    $ git checkout danube.2.0

Clone the OPNFV code Git repository without a SSH key
-----------------------------------------------------

You can also opt to clone the code repository without a SSH key:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/fuel

Make sure to checkout the release tag as described above.

Support for building behind a http/https/rsync proxy
====================================================

The build system is able to make use of a web proxy setup if the
http_proxy, https_proxy, no_proxy (if needed) and RSYNC_PROXY or
RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG environment variables have been set before invoking make.

The proxy setup must permit port 80 (http) and 443 (https).
Rsync protocol is currently not used during build process.

Important note about the host Docker daemon settings
----------------------------------------------------

The Docker daemon on the host must be configured to use the http proxy
for it to be able to pull the base Ubuntu 14.04 image from the Docker
registry before invoking make! In Ubuntu this is done by adding a line
like:

.. code-block:: bash

    export http_proxy="http://10.0.0.1:8888/"

to /etc/default/docker and restarting the Docker daemon.

Setting proxy environment variables prior to build
--------------------------------------------------

The build system will make use the following environment variables
that needs to be exported to subshells by using export (bash) or
setenv (csh/tcsh).

.. code-block:: bash

     http_proxy (or HTTP_PROXY)
     https_proxy (or HTTP_PROXY)
     no_proxy (or NO_PROXY)
     RSYNC_PROXY
     RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG

As an example, these are the settings that were put in the user's
.bashrc when verifying the proxy build functionality:

.. code-block:: bash

    export RSYNC_PROXY=10.0.0.1:8888
    export http_proxy=http://10.0.0.1:8888
    export https_proxy=http://10.0.0.1:8888
    export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,.consultron.com,.sock

Using a ssh proxy for the rsync connection
------------------------------------------

If the proxy setup is not allowing the rsync protocol, an alternative
solution is to use a SSH tunnel to a machine capable of accessing the
outbound port 873. Set the RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG according to the rsync
manual page (for example to "ssh <username>@<hostname> nc %H 873")
to enable this. Also note that netcat needs to be installed on the
remote system!

Make sure that the ssh command also refers to the user on the remote
system, as the command itself will be run from the Docker build container
as the root user (but with the invoking user's SSH keys).

Configure your build environment
================================

** Configuring the build environment should not be performed if building
standard Danube release **

Select the versions of the components you want to build by editing the
fuel/build/config.mk file.

Non official build: Selecting which plugins to build
====================================================

In order to cut the build time for unofficial builds (made by an
individual developer locally), the selection if which Fuel plugins to
build (if any) can be done by environment variable
"BUILD_FUEL_PLUGINS" prior to building.

Only the plugin targets from fuel/build/f_isoroot/Makefile that are
specified in the environment variable will then be built. In order to
completely disable the building of plugins, the environment variable
is set to " ". When using this functionality, the resulting iso file
will be prepended with the prefix "unofficial-" to clearly indicate
that this is not a full build.

This method of plugin selection is not meant to be used from within
Gerrit!

========
Building
========

There are two methods available for building Fuel:

- A low level method using Make

- An abstracted method using build.sh

Low level build method using make
=================================

The low level method is based on Make:

From the <fuel/build> directory, invoke <make [target]>

Following targets exist:

- none/all -  this will:

  - Initialize the docker build environment

  - Build Fuel from upstream (as defined by fuel-build/config-spec)

  - Build the OPNFV defined plugins/features from upstream

  - Build the defined additions to fuel (as defined by the structure
    of this framework)

  - Apply changes and patches to fuel (as defined by the structure of
    this framework)

  - Reconstruct a fuel .iso image

- clean - this will remove all artifacts from earlier builds.

- debug - this will simply enter the build container without starting a build, from here you can start a build by enter "make iso"

If the build is successful, you will find the generated ISO file in
the <fuel/build/release> subdirectory!

Abstracted build method using build.sh
======================================

The abstracted build method uses the <fuel/ci/build.sh> script which
allows you to:

- Create and use a build cache - significantly speeding up the
  build time if upstream repositories have not changed.

- push/pull cache and artifacts to an arbitrary URI (http(s):, file:, ftp:)

For more info type <fuel/ci/build.sh -h>.

=========
Artifacts
=========

The artifacts produced are:

- <OPNFV_XXXX.iso> - Which represents the bootable Fuel image, XXXX is
  replaced with the build identity provided to the build system

- <OPNFV_XXXX.iso.txt> - Which holds version metadata.
