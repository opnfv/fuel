Important Notes
===============

These notes provides release information for the use of Fuel as deployment

This Fraser artifact provides Fuel as the deployment stage tool in the
OPNFV CI pipeline including:

- Documentation built by Jenkins

  - overall OPNFV documentation

  - this document (release notes)

  - installation instructions

- Automated deployment of Fraser with running on baremetal or a nested
  hypervisor environment (KVM)
