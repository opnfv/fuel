OPNFV Fuel Release Notes
************************

Abstract
========

This document provides the release notes for ``Iruya`` release with the Fuel
deployment toolchain.

Starting with ``Gambia`` release, both ``x86_64`` and ``aarch64`` architectures
are supported at the same time by the ``fuel`` codebase.

Important Notes
===============

This is the OPNFV ``Iruya`` release that implements the deploy stage of the
OPNFV CI pipeline via Fuel.

Fuel is based on the `MCP`_ installation tool chain.
More information available at `Mirantis Cloud Platform Documentation`_.

The goal of the ``Iruya`` release and this Fuel-based deployment process is
to establish a lab ready platform accelerating further development
of the OPNFV infrastructure.

Carefully follow the installation instructions.

Summary
=======

``Iruya`` release with the Fuel deployment toolchain will establish an OPNFV
target system on a Pharos compliant lab infrastructure. The current definition
of an OPNFV target system is OpenStack Queens combined with an SDN
controller, such as OpenDaylight. The system is deployed with OpenStack High
Availability (HA) for most OpenStack services.

Fuel also supports non-HA deployments, which deploys a
single controller, one gateway node and a number of compute nodes.

Fuel supports ``x86_64``, ``aarch64`` or ``mixed`` architecture clusters.

Furthermore, Fuel is capable of deploying scenarios in a ``baremetal``,
``virtual`` or ``hybrid`` fashion. ``virtual`` deployments use multiple VMs on
the Jump Host and internal networking to simulate the ``baremetal`` deployment.

For ``Iruya``, the typical use of Fuel as an OpenStack installer is
supplemented with OPNFV unique components such as:

- `OpenDaylight`_

As well as OPNFV-unique configurations of the Hardware and Software stack.

This ``Iruya`` artifact provides Fuel as the deployment stage tool in the
OPNFV CI pipeline including:

- Automated (Jenkins, RTD) documentation build & publish (multiple documents);
- Automated (Jenkins) build & publish of Salt Master Docker image;
- Automated (Jenkins) deployment of ``Iruya`` running on baremetal or a nested
  hypervisor environment (KVM);
- Automated (Jenkins) validation of the ``Iruya`` deployment
