Abstract:
---------
The directory contains configuration files for different OPNFV deployment
feature scenarios used by Fuel@OPNFV, eg.:
- High availability configuration
- Type of SDN controller to be deployed
- OPNFV collaboration project features to be deployed.
- Provisioning of any other sevices

Creating a new plugin
---------------------
Creating a new plugin involves creating a plugin config yaml file in
/deploy/config/plugins. The filename should comply to following structure:
fuel-<plugin_name>_<version>.yaml.
The plugin configuration must include plugin configuration metadata as below:

plugin-config-metadata:
  title:
  version:
  created:
  comment:

Moreover, naturaly the plugin configuration must include the plugin yaml
fragment, eg:

opendaylight:
  metadata:
    enabled: true
    label: OpenDaylight Lithium plugin
.......

Creating a new deployment scenario
----------------------------------
Creating a new deployment scenario involve creating a deployment scenario
yaml file under deploy/scenario/. The filename should comply to following
format: <ha | no-ha>_<SDN Controller>_<feature-1>_..._<feature-n>_<version>.yaml

The deployment configuration file must contain configuration metadata as stated
below:

deployment-scenario-metadata:
   title:
   version:
   created:
   comment:

To include fuel plugins, use the stack-extentions key:
stack-extensions, eg:

stack-extensions:
   - module: opendaylight
     module-config-name: fuel-odl
     module-config-version: 0.0.1
     module-config-override:
       # Module config overrides
       rest_api_port:
         value: '8282'
       enable_gbp:
         value: false
       enable_l3_odl:
         value: true
       enable_sfc:
         value: false

"module-config-name" and "module-config-version" must correspond to how
the plugin configuration yaml was named.
Everything under the "module-config-override" overrides the corresponding
keys in the plugin config yaml file, this can for instance be used to configure
the plugin.

Everything under the "dea-override-config" overrides corresponding keys in the dea_base.yaml and dea_pod_override.yaml.
You must at least provide {environment:{mode:'value},{net_segment_type:'value'}
and {nodes:....} in order to configure the HA mode, network segmentation types
and role to node assignments.
Other ovverides may also be used to enable stack features such as ceph, heat,
etc.
Example:

dea-override-config:
  environment:
    mode: ha
    net_segment_type: tun
  wanted_release: Mitaka on Ubuntu 14.04
  nodes:
  - id: 1
    interfaces: interfaces_1
    role: mongo,controller,opendaylight
    transformations: transformations_1
  - id: 2
    interfaces: interfaces_1
    role: mongo,controller
    transformations: transformations_1
  - id: 3
    interfaces: interfaces_1
    role: mongo,controller
    transformations: transformations_1
  - id: 4
    interfaces: interfaces_1
    role: ceph-osd,compute
    transformations: transformations_1
  - id: 5
    interfaces: interfaces_1
    role: ceph-osd,compute
    transformations: transformations_1

  settings:
    editable:
      additional_components:
        ceilometer:
          description: If selected, Ceilometer component will be installed
          label: Install Ceilometer
          type: checkbox
          value: true
          weight: 40
        heat:
          description: ''

        metadata:
          label: Additional Components
          weight: 20
      storage:
        ephemeral_ceph:
          description: Configures Nova to store ephemeral volumes in RBD. This works
            best if Ceph is enabled for volumes and images, too. Enables live migration
            of all types of Ceph backed VMs (without this option, live migration will
            only work with VMs launched from Cinder volumes).
          label: Ceph RBD for ephemeral volumes (Nova)
          type: checkbox
          value: true
          weight: 75
        images_ceph:
          description: Configures Glance to use the Ceph RBD backend to store images.
            If enabled, this option will prevent Swift from installing.
          label: Ceph RBD for images (Glance)
          restrictions:
          - settings:storage.images_vcenter.value == true: Only one Glance backend could
              be selected.
          type: checkbox
          value: true
          weight: 30

Optionally you may override the pod dha defenition under the
"dha-override-config" key.

Short names
-----------
scenario.yaml provides a mapping between a deployment scenario short-name
and one or several deployment scenario configuration yaml files.

Other
-----
These configuration files are used by deploy.sh provided by Fuel@OPNFV, e.g.
deploy.sh will clone this repo when deploying.
