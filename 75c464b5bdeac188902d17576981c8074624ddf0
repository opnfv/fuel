      "message": "This is one big hack. I messed with this for the last couple of days, and forcing an explicit boot image download needs to happen after a certain time (no idea what is the exact condition behind the scenes, but grepping the rackd.log for a DHCP probe followed by a rack (re-)registration seems to be a good test so far; anything earlier than that will either fail, or download only bootloader images?!). This also covers the corner case where MaaS services run into a race condition and DHCP probing cannot be performed the first time.\nI would really love to drop this patch in favor of some better alternative, but I\u0027m out of ideas.",
