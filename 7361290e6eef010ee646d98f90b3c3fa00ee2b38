Just a question.\n\nI just noted that on my test testup (Ubuntu 14.04)  I don\u0027t have libyaml-dev installed, but libyaml-0-2.\n\nI do have python-yaml installed though from the base Ubuntu repos and that has a dependency to libyaml-0-2.\n\nBelow pyaml is pip installed instead I see, so I guess that\u0027s why it\u0027s the libyaml-dev package that\u0027s needed?\n\nAnd as a short explanation, libyaml-dev has a package dependency to libyaml-0-2. The latter provides the versioned so-files, the former install the non-versioned symlink).",
