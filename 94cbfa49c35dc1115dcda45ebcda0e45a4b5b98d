      "message": "Good that you put this information here since this will introduce dependency between job names on Jenkins - unless we fix it of course.\n\nJust giving some more details below.\n\nJenkins determines the execution location dynamically based on the job names and execution numbers by default and telling others to look at this directory is something we need to refrain from doing. If for one reason job names change, this unnecessarily impacts other jobs and break functest and yardstick until they\u0027re adjusted.\n\nOf course we can solve this in another way and pass these files to functest and yardstick some way - copying these files to a predefined/agreed folder (named after the scenario perhaps for example) once the deployment is done and pointing location to functest and yardstick. (I don\u0027t like this either but we have to move on. We can fix this in better after the release.)",

      "message": "Another way is that I re-create these files with a script prior to func-test execution if you can you provide the same parameters to as you did for deploy?\nOr we upload them to artifactory, these files are pretty interesting to have in artifactory as they are the soul source for the actual deployment configuration - provides good traceability.\nThar is actually what I now do in the fuel devel-pipeline, these files get uploaded to the artifact store with the logs, .iso files, etc.",

      "message": "I think both of your suggestions are great.\n\nFor execution purposes, it is better have a script to get them created like you suggested and this script can be used by anybody; functest, yardstick on jenkins or humans. \n\nBUT; please do not lose time for this if you have other/important stuff to fix. We can live with a workaround for a while.\n\nAnd storing them on artifact repo is important for traceability as you pointed out. This will require us to think about the final location of these files on artifact repo which is pretty messy at the moment.",
