This is an example of a modification of the bridge and bonding of interfaces.
Rationale: Fuel currently don't support bonding of the "Admin" network, which
becomes a problem if you want to co-locate the single "Admin" and the redundant
bonded "Management" network on one and the same physical network in order to minimize
number of NICs, switches and cables.
This example show how you can modify the bridge and bonding settings and scripts to
achieve co-location. Of course the FUEL GUI becomes shorted in this respect, I.e.
the "admin" and "management" network cant be dragged across the NICs in the GUI.

The f_example_control_bond has the following structure:

    control-bond  control-bond.pp

Makefile:
Invoked by the git root Makefile, copies the files up to the release build
directory.

control-bond:
The control-bond file is the .init file orchestrating the interface-, bridge-
and bond actions required for enabling the control bond

control-bond.pp:
The control-bond.pp is the pupet manifest orchestrating the placement and
configuration of the control-bond shell script file.

To activate this example feature, add "SUBDIRS += f_example_control_bond" in the git root Makefile.
