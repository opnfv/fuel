The makefile on this level is used for *creating* the Docker image
used for building in Ubuntu 12.04 context.

There are two requirements before running make on this level:

1. You need to have Docker installed on your system

2. If in a corporate network, make sure to have a valid DNS config in
   your /etc/default/docker, e.g:

   DOCKER_OPTS=" --dns=8.8.8.8 --dns=8.8.8.4"

The top level makefile will refer to the "runcontext" file in order to
run the build process as the current user with the current working
directory available to the container.
