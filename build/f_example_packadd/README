This is an example of a an addition of an arbitrary debian package: foobar
It adds the debian package foobar_1.0-1 to the fuel .iso image and deploys it
to the controllers and the computes.

The f_example_packadd has the following structure:
.
+--------+----------+-----------+------------+
         |          |           |            |
      puppet/    Makefile     README    foobar_1.0-1/
         |                  (this file)  (deb pack)
         |
         |
      modules/
         |
         |
         |
       opnfv/
         |
         |
         |
     manifests/
         |
         |
         |
     foobar.pp

Makefile:
Invoked by the git root Makefile, based on the foobar_1.0-1 deb pack artifacts, and the pupet manifests, it builds a deb package
and adds it together with the manifest to a fuel build artifact directory, such that it eventually gets built into the new fuel .iso

foobar_1.0-1:
Contains arbitrary debian package artifacts

foobar.pp:
Controls the installation and configuration of foobar

To activate this example feature, add "SUBDIRS += f_example_packadd" in the git root Makefile.
