This purpose of this framework is to:

1)      Build fuel baseline from upstream OpenStack Fuel repos (builds in a docker container to isolate dependencies from host
        and full re-producability)
2)      Apply arbitrary changes to the fuel baseline, consistent and non volatile:
        - Add arbitrary packages with puppet modules for install and config. to be applied on controllers as well as computes.
        - Change any stack-, or other pack config. using puppet
        - Apply patches to the baseline.
        - Etc.
3)      Re factor/rebuild the .iso image for deployment (also builds in a container, for the same reason as mentioned above)

For detailed instructions on how to add content, configuration, build and deply - please see: DOC/
